[The lazy system2]

One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control thoughts and actions “suggested” by System 1, allowing some to be expressed directly in behavior and suppressing or modifying others.

Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.

Just as in the bat-and-ball problem, a plausible answer comes to mind immediately. Overriding it requires hard work - the insistent idea that "It's true, it's true" makes it difficult to check the logic and most people do not take the trouble to think through the problem.

Facts that we know do not always come to mind when we need them. Intelligence is not only the ability to reason; it is also the ability to find relevant material in memory and to deploy attention when needed. Memory function is an attribute of System 1. However, everyone has the option of slowing down to conduct an active search of memory  for all possibly relevant facts - just as the could slow down to check the intuitive answer in the bat-and-ball problem. The extent of deliberate checking and search is a characteristic of System 2, which varies among individuals.

Failing these minitests appears to be, at least to some extent, a matter of insufficient motivation, not trying hard enough. These students can solve much more difficult problems when they are not tempted to accept a superficially plausible answer that comes readily to mind. Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called "engaged". They are more alert, more intellectually active, less willing to be satisfied with superficially attractive answers, more skeptical about their intuitions. The psychologist Keith Stanovich wold call them more rational.
