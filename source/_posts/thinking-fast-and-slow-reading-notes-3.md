Thinking fast and slow 读书笔记3

当你快速跑步的时候，难以进行深入的思考，同时做两件事情会消耗更多的self-control.

好在不是所有的cognitive work都让人厌烦，有种被称为心流的状态，可以让你长时间的保持专注而不觉得累，甚至会忘了时间忘了自我。心流区分了两种精力消耗，专注和刻意的注意力控制。

[The depleted system2]
It is now a well-established proposition that both self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work. Studies have shown that people who are simultaneously challenged by a demanding cognitive task and by a temptation are more likely to yield to the temptation.

people who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexiest language, and make superficial judgments in social situations.

All variants of voluntary effort--cognitive, emotional, or physical--draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energe.

An effort of will or self-control is tiring, if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion.
